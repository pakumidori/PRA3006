            <h1>Welcome to your tool for drug interaction insights!</h1>
            <p>
                The Drug Checker project is designed as a user-friendly tool to provide initial insights into potential drug interactions. 
                By offering a straightforward interface. Users can quickly access information about specific substances and their interactions, creating awareness about the potential risks involved. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We emphazise the use of this tool as a means for harm reduction! We do not encourage the use of drugs, even less so the combination thereof. 
                This tool is meant to educate and make sure that you do not experience any physical harm, if you are determined to combine recreational drugs.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Always conduct your own research!

            </h2>
            <p>
                This tool is not intended to replace professional advice or comprehensive research but rather acts as a complementary resource. The information presented is derived from reliable datasets
                 and sparql-powered queries, ensuring users receive accurate and up-to-date insights. By incorporating visual and interactive elements, such as dynamic drug clouds and tailored interaction results, 
                 the Drug Checker is built to engage users effectively while maintaining clarity and accessibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the project aims to promote awareness and harm reduction, users are encouraged to conduct more in-depth research and consult professionals when dealing with potentially hazardous substances or medical concerns. 
                This project serves as a reminder of the importance of informed decision-making in all aspects of substance use and interaction, reinforcing safety and responsibility as core principles.
